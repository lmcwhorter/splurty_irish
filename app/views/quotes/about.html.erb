  <h1>About Splurty Irish</h1>
  <p>
    Splurty Irish was built by Laura McWhorter, a woman with so much time on her hands she thought it would be fun to take up Irish. And programming. For some reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although she's only starting out, she's having fun making stuff for the web. Sometimes she has fun talking Irish. Other times she doubles the fun by combining the Irish and the programming.
