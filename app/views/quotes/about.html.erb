  <h1>About Splurty Irish</h1>
  <p>
    Splurty Irish was built by Laura McWhorter, a woman with so much time on her hands she thought it would be fun to take up Irish. And programming. For some reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although she's only starting out, she's having fun making stuff for the web. Sometimes she has fun talking Irish. Other times she doubles the fun by combining the Irish and the programming.

    If you'd like to know more about her web development courses, you can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/"> drink from the Firehose right here</a>. If you'd like to see where spends her summers, you can <a target ="_blank" href="http://www.oideas-gael.com/en/"> check out the school here</a>.

    <p>
      Laura McWhorter is a teacher turned instructional designer and technical writer who dabbles in code for fun. She has worked in five countries on four continents teaching everything from general English skills to patient interviewing techniques. In her spare time, she studies Irish and spends her summers in glorious County Donegal where patient locals endure her questionable linguistic skills, at least until last call at the pub.
